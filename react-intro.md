# WHAT IS REACT?

- Invented by Facebook (Meta) 
- Was made to be scalable 
- Companies that use React - Airnbnb, Netflix, Uber Yahoo, Dropbox, NYT, Asana
- Yarn package manager (can also use npm) 

# Component-based
- build individual components
- put those components together to create the app
- extremely scalable
- components are REUSABLE
- It is UI focused

# Scalability
 - create code that will work under many conditions

# Reusable
- Uses functions to create the UI elements
- Function returns an object that holds JSX (combo of HTML and JS)
- object holds data and behavior


# DOM
- Document Object Model - visual representation of your code

- REACT USES A VIRTUAL DOM - this is key point
    - lives behind the DOM - invisible layer
    - listens to the individual nodes in the DOM, compares the change
    - refreshes only the elememts that changed. (no full page refresh!)

# REACT COMPONENTS

- JSX combo of extended JS and HTL
- Component Call 
 - <Component/>
